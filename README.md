# Mobile_Price_Classfication

The price of a product is the most important attribute of marketing that product. One of those products where price matters a lot is a smartphone because 
it comes with a lot of features so that a company thinks a lot about how to price this mobile which can justify the features and also cover the marketing
and manufacturing costs of the mobile. 

Mobile phones are the best selling electronic devices as people keep updating their cell phones whenever they find new features in a new device. 
Thousands of mobiles are sold daily, in such a situation it is a very difficult task for someone who is planning to set up their own mobile phone
business to decide what the price of the mobile should be.
